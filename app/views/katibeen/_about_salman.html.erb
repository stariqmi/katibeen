        As a student of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, I fell in love with web development. It was only a matter of time before my friends and colleagues diagnosed me with OCD - Obsessive Coding Disorder. I often forget to eat all day when coding. Infact, this passion of mine developed into my new means of sustenance. I constantly find myself striving to learn and accomplish more. I am a huge fan of minimalism in web design and seem to have fallen in love with Ruby on Rails. When im not coding, I tend to enjoy watching Game of Thrones or read The Wheel of Time.
